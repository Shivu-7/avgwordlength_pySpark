# avgwordlength_pySpark


<BR>
It is a simple, minimal, ubiquitous file system. In the code I have implemented a rough approximation of how FAT works.

### Brief Intro
> For any text input, you need to write code that should report the average length of words that begin with  ‘a’, ‘b’, and so forth. 

For example, for input:
No now is definitely not the time

The output would be:

N 2.0
n 3.0
d 10.0
i 2.0
t 3.5
